1. make a collection of all token eips.
2. learn and translate eip raw page.
3. abstract the token contract interface into ../interface file as a solidity interface contract.
4. clone the fully token contract in the implement part and store it in ../ path.
5. test the implement token contract via Remix+Testnet and Truffle+Ganache.
6. when this job finished, you should do some conclusion work in your github and blogs.
